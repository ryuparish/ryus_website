Sometimes, I like working on hobbies or projects for a long time.

During those times, I would usually end up collecting a bunch of
links, screenshots, and general notes regarding the activity.

Eventually I was annoyed with holding my phone, looking a piece of
paper with a handwritten note, and looking at my computer screen all at the same time.

I wrote this barely-working (but has a small test suite!) application
to do the bare minimum and search over any notes, links, and/or 
screenshots that I upload through to it. Still working on syncing
with Apple Notes on the Iphone to the Mac (just feeling lazy). Source: <a href="https://github.com/ryuparish/memosearch">memosearch github</a>
