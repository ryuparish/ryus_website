For some reason, during my freshman year at my community college, I really wanted to learn about low-level computer
programming / systems programming. I actually wanted to get into bare-metal programming (sort of still do), but lost interest when
I got into NLP around the same time.

Anywho, I ended bricking my whole computer after messing around with GRUB alongside messing with a file shredder. Eventually,
I got curious as to how binary files and assembly worked in the first place. So I downloaded this book and did all the problems
except a few (like 2 I think). The assembly probably doesn't work on all test cases, but it was pretty cool to learn about coding in assembly. Here is the link to the buggy repo if you want to see: <a href="https://github.com/ryuparish/MIPS">my buggy MIPS code</a>
