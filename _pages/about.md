<br>Hello!

My name is Ryu, prounouced like kanga`roo`.

I am a Junior at the University of Washington. I am incredibly thankful to be working under [Ellen Wu](http://ellenmellon.github.io/) in the [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/). I transferred in from [Tarrant County College](https://www.tccd.edu/) in Fort Worth, Texas back in 2021 to pursue a BS in Computer Science at UW.

My research interests in NLP are Language Modeling and Knowledge Representation, specifically in Question Answering, Prompt Tuning, and Knowledge Graphs.

The ultimate goal in my research is to create an optimal, generalizable structure that analyzes text and expresses super-human thinking ability. Such a system should also be easy to use/interact with.
