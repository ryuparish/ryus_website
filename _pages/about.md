<br>Hello!

My name is Ryu, prounouced like kanga`roo`. I am a software engineer at Google, working on AI infrastructure (my website and content are not affliated with Google in any way). I have a huge passion and interest for computers and their role in human society.

I was previously a BS/MS student at the University of Washington and worked on NLP-SE (Natural Language Processing and Software Engineering) research at [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/index.html) advised by [Ren√© Just](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/) and mentored by [Sam Kaufman](http://samk.name/).

Before that, I was advised by [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html) and mentored by [Ellen Wu](http://ellenmellon.github.io/) at the [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) and worked on [Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00746).

I am incredibly grateful to have worked with so many wonderful researchers and am still very interested in working on Machine Learning for Code, Natural Language Processing, and Software Engineering projects.

I transferred to the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington from [Tarrant County College](https://www.tccd.edu/) in Hurst, Texas back in 2021 to pursue a BS in Computer Science.

Here is my [CV](https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/assets/pdf/RyuParishSEResume2024.pdf).
