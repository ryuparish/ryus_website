<br>Hello!

My name is Ryu, prounouced like kanga`roo`.

I am a Senior at the University of Washington. I am currently collaborating with PLSE on a potential project. 

Previously, I was mentored by [Ellen Wu](http://ellenmellon.github.io/) at the [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) and worked on a project about challenging language models to handle [Mixed-Initiative Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00746). It was difficult but the things I learned were incredibly valuable and I am extremely thankful to have gotten to work with Ellen.

I transferred to the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington from [Tarrant County College](https://www.tccd.edu/) in Fort Worth, Texas back in 2021 to pursue a BS in Computer Science.

My research interests in NLP are Knowledge Representation and Language Modeling, specifically in Question Answering, Prompt Tuning, and Information Retrieval. I also really like applications of NLP to other fields of [Security, Text Analysis, Programming Languages...] and tools that utilize work from NLP like search engines, assistants, and translators.
