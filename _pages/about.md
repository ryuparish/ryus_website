<br>Hello!

My name is Ryu, prounouced like kanga`roo`.

I am a BS/MS (Senior) student at the University of Washington, formerly (on a break) leading a NLP-SE project at [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/index.html) advised by [Ren√© Just](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/) and mentored by [Sam Kaufman](http://samk.name/).

Before that, I was advised by [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html) and mentored by [Ellen Wu](http://ellenmellon.github.io/) at the [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) and worked on a project about challenging language models to handle [Mixed-Initiative Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00746). It was difficult but the things I learned were incredibly valuable and I am extremely thankful to have gotten to work with Ellen.

I transferred to the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington from [Tarrant County College](https://www.tccd.edu/) in Fort Worth, Texas back in 2021 to pursue a BS in Computer Science.

My research interests are in Machine Learning for Code, especially in applying Large Language Models to Code Understanding. I believe that all software should be open sourced.

Here is my [CV](https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/assets/pdf/RyuParishEngineeringResume-1.pdf).
