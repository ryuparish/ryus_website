Oh Tokyo, okay. Why did you move from Japan to the US?”</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>My biological family is too dysfunctional to agree on the truth of how we came to the US. There have been many times where my sister and I have built up the courage to ask about this seemingly really touchy subject in our family. Each time, they tell a story that makes sense but contradicts the other family members’ stories.
As a biological family, we don’t take pictures often or organize documents in a single household (due to violent divorce), and knowing what happened is difficult.</p>

<p>Below are different responses we have received to the question, “Why did we move to America?” from different family members:</p>

<p><strong>My biological father: “I brought you to the US because the education system is better, and we wanted the kids [Ryu and his sister] to be successful.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>My biological grandmother: “When [Ryu and his sister] were children in Japan, I allowed them to move to America because your mother wanted to move to the US with her husband.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>My biological mother: “Your father’s passport was about to be taken away due to child support issues involving a previous child he had. This passport issue conflicted with employment and pushed him to go back to the US alone. I then took my children [Ryu and his sister] to the United States, we were already married at that point.”</strong></p>

<p>As of November 2025, my sister is soon to be a pharmacist, and I am a software engineer. We have somehow become grown adults without knowing how the ground under us really got there.</p>

<p>This question is really common for normal interactions and conversations in society, but I seriously do not know the true answer nor do I want to.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[People ask this question in public a lot.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What got you into computer science?</title><link href="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2025/what-was-your-childhood-like/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What got you into computer science?" /><published>2025-10-30T09:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-30T09:26:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2025/what-was-your-childhood-like</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2025/what-was-your-childhood-like/"><![CDATA[<p>My sister and I have to lie every time someone asks us this question; it is exhausting to keep lying over and over about it.</p>

<p>Most of my childhood memories revolve around deadbeat dads and an abusive mom, unfortunately. Around 2007, a <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/109041744/tro-ord-set-hrg-for-temp-ord-1-8-08-830am">violent divorce</a> led to the abuse and neglect of both me (8 years old at the time) and my sister (10 years old at the time). In the early years with mom, violence was a very frequent, more-than-weekly occurrence. My mother mostly targeted my sister, and I was punished if I tried to call the police. It affected everything I dreamt about, wished for on my birthdays, prayed for at night, and thought about in church, hoping for it to someday end. The intensity tapered off year by year, but lasted until 2017.</p>

<p>I learned computer science because it would give me useful skills to eventually (financially) escape my mother’s <a href="https://womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/coercive-control/#:~:text=Coercive%20control%20is%20an%20act,punish%2C%20or%20frighten%20their%20victim.">coercive control</a>. I became interested after using <a href="https://digiex.net/threads/horizon-xbox-360-usb-modding-tool-download-latest-version.11775/">horizonmb</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modding">mod</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_(video_game)">Borderlands</a> on the Xbox 360 when I was 9 (2010). Then, I started programming on Codecademy python courses and Harvard’s CS50 online after getting my own computer for “schoolwork” when I was in middle school.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.texadmissions.com/">Kevin Martin</a> was absolutely instrumental in helping me get into a good college by helping me write my whole story in a college-focused way. He geniunely changed my life and I could not have gotten to where I am without him.</p>

<p>When people ask me “So what got you into computers as a kid, Ryu?” in public, or when I am being interviewed, I usually give a white lie. I have had people accuse me of making up my childhood after my white lies contradicted themselves, so I wrote this. I have no hard feelings against the question itself; I just need to write this where people can read it and understand.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[People ask this question in public and in my DMs.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A list of ways people have pronounced my name.</title><link href="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/name/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A list of ways people have pronounced my name." /><published>2022-01-04T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-04T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/name</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/name/"><![CDATA[<p><br />Ree-you (grand champion) - The most common mispronounciation. I will still say “yeah?”
<br />Rye - Like the bread.
<br />Rye-you - The second most common mispronounciation. Still will respond to it.
<br />Ray-you - Occasionally this is said.
<br />Are-you - I am. I am Ryu. This was pronounced over the intercom in middle school.
<br />Ryan - Sometimes they just act like they read it wrong I think. Sometimes they actually read it wrong too.
<br />garoo - I think this person misheard when I said, “It’s Ryu, like kangaroo”
<br />Gru - My little sister called me this for almost 2 years. Like the minions movie guy.
<br /> 
<br />I have come up with the most non-ambiguous, clearly said, hard-to-mishear name of all time: three. If you cannot get my name right, just call me Three, like the number.
<br />I refuse to believe that you can mishear Three. It is just way too hard to not hear the number Three. Plus, who else would be named Three? I would always know you are talking to me.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just call me Ryu like kangaroo.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How I understand pointers in C.</title><link href="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/pointers-in-c/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I understand pointers in C." /><published>2022-01-04T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-04T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/pointers-in-c</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/pointers-in-c/"><![CDATA[<p>I have a hard time learning certain things in computer science. Pointers in C was one of those things that took many re-learnings to understand since there are so many ways to misinterpret how they work.</p>

<p>I also have a mental representation in my mind that helped me never forget how deferencing and addresses in C work:</p>

<div class="caption">
    My drawing of my mental image.

<p>This is representation of the variable: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int x = 8;</code>. The spring is the address and 8 is the value.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="How-To" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I try to explain my understanding of pointers in C.]]></summary></entry></feed>
