I will still say “yeah?”
<br />Rye - Like the bread.
<br />Rye-you - The second most common mispronounciation. Still will respond to it.
<br />Ray-you - Occasionally this is said.
<br />Are-you - I am. I am Ryu. This was pronounced over the intercom in middle school.
<br />Ryan - Sometimes they just act like they read it wrong I think. Sometimes they actually read it wrong too.
<br />garoo - I think this person misheard when I said, “It’s Ryu, like kangaroo”
<br />Gru - My little sister called me this for almost 2 years. Like the minions movie guy.
<br /> 
<br />I have come up with the most non-ambiguous, clearly said, hard-to-mishear name of all time: three. If you cannot get my name right, just call me Three, like the number.
<br />I refuse to believe that you can mishear Three. It is just way too hard to not hear the number Three. Plus, who else would be named Three? I would always know you are talking to me.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just call me Ryu like kangaroo.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How I understand pointers in C.</title><link href="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/pointers-in-c/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I understand pointers in C." /><published>2022-01-04T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-04T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/pointers-in-c</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ryuparish.github.io/ryus_website/blog/2022/pointers-in-c/"><![CDATA[<p>I have a hard time learning certain things in computer science. Pointers in C was one of those things that took many re-learnings to understand since there are so many ways to misinterpret how they work.</p>

<p>I also have a mental representation in my mind that helped me never forget how deferencing and addresses in C work:</p>

<div class="caption">
    My drawing of my mental image.

<p>This is representation of the variable: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int x = 8;</code>. The spring is the address and 8 is the value.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="How-To" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I try to explain my understanding of pointers in C.]]></summary></entry></feed>
