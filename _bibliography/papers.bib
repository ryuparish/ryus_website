  title={INSCIT: Information-Seeking Conversations with Mixed-Initiative Interactions},
  author={Zeqiu Wu, Ryu Parish, Hao Cheng, Sewon Min, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Mari Ostendorf, Hannaneh Hajishirzi},
  abstract={In an information-seeking conversation, a user
  converses with an agent to ask a series of ques-
  tions that can often be under- or over-specified.
  An ideal agent would first identify that they
  were in such a situation by searching through
  their underlying knowledge source and then ap-
  propriately interacting with a user to resolve
  it. However, most existing studies either fail
  to or artificially incorporate such agent-side
  initiatives. In this work, we present INSCIT
  (pronounced Insight), a dataset for Information-
  Seeking Conversations with mixed-initiative
  Interactions. It contains a total of 4.7K user-
  agent turns from 805 human-human conversa-
  tions where the agent searches over Wikipedia
  and either asks for clarification or provides rel-
  evant information to address user queries. We
  define two subtasks, namely evidence passage
  identification and response generation, as well
  as a new human evaluation protocol to assess
  the model performance. We report results of
  two strong baselines based on state-of-the-art
  models of conversational knowledge identifi-
  cation and open-domain question answering.
  Both models significantly underperform hu-
  mans and fail to generate coherent and infor-
  mative responses, suggesting ample room for
  improvement in future studies.},
