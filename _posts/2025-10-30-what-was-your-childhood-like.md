Trigger warning: graphic violence.


I want to answer this question for you since you clicked on this post.


My sister and I have to lie every time someone asks us this question; it is exhausting to keep lying over and over about it.


Most of my childhood centered around deadbeat dads and mentally ill moms. Around 2007, a [violent divorce](https://trellis.law/doc/109041744/tro-ord-set-hrg-for-temp-ord-1-8-08-830am) led to the abuse and neglect of both me and my sister, Aika. In the early years, violence was a very frequent, more-than-weekly occurrence, which then decreased to monthly after a few years, and finally yearly by the time we both moved out of state for college.

When I was young I was afraid of the sunset. Sunset happened right before my mother would come home from working at the airport and abuse my sister, while I quietly watched in fear. Through the years, my sister had strands of hair pulled out, her shoulder dislocated, and a black eye. We would be hand-on-ankle dragged then thrown into the garage with the door slammed shut when we "disrespected" our mother. When my step father would get angry enough, I would get choked against a wall and called a "whiteboy" because I was "acting crazy".

Our mother manipulated everyone including us \[Ryu and his sister\] to believe we were normal as a small family. We thought this was what happened when children got in trouble by their parents all the time. Both of us now suffer from severe PTSD (I have been through therapy and am open to talking in private).

I tried to run away multiple times, and each time I would have to return due to financial pressure since I was a teenage runaway. I tried my best to earn my way out by working part time jobs at Sprouts, Slim Chickens, Valvoline Oil Change, and Jiffy Lube because of their lower age restrictions. Eventually I was disowned by my grandfather, and although I had confidence in my computer skills to make money, I wanted aid for my college tuition (I wanted to sneak Out-of-state). I faked an apology to my grandfather and planned to go somewhere far from Texas (Seattle).

[Kevin Martin](https://www.texadmissions.com/) was absolutely instrumental in helping me get into a good college by helping me write my whole story in a college-focused way. He geniunely changed my life and I could not have gotten to where I am without him.

Most of my peers seem to remember childhood with school events, family outings, and special interest groups being most memorable when asked in a public setting. Unfortunately, the above memories are what dominated my life choices and thoughts during my childhood (~8 years old to ~17 years old, 2007-2017). I learned computer science because it would give me useful skills to financially escape my mother's [coercive control](https://womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/coercive-control/#:~:text=Coercive%20control%20is%20an%20act,punish%2C%20or%20frighten%20their%20victim.), and it happened to be something I was naturally interested in too (I became interested after using [horizonmb](https://digiex.net/threads/horizon-xbox-360-usb-modding-tool-download-latest-version.11775/) to [mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modding) [Borderlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_(video_game)) on the Xbox when I was 9).


When people ask me "So... how was your childhood, Ryu?” in a public setting, or when I am being interviewed, or when someone wants to get to know me, I usually give a white lie. I have had people accuse me of making up my childhood after my lies contradicted themselves, so I wrote this. I have no hard feelings against the question itself; I just need to write this where curious people can read it.
