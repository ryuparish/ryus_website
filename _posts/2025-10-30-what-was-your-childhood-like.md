Trigger warning: abuse.


I want to answer this question for you since you clicked on this post.


My sister and I have to lie every time someone asks us this question; it is exhausting. People who are curious enough to ask this question should get to know the answer.


I am from a dysfunctional family and have an especially dysfunctional mother. My mother neglected and abused both of her children in 2010-2017. In the early years, violence was a very frequent, more-than-weekly occurrence, which then decreased to monthly and finally yearly by the time we moved out of state for college.


When I was young I was afraid of the sunset. Sunset happened right before my mother would come home from working at the airport and abuse my sister, while I watched in terror. Through the years, my sister had strands of hair pulled out, her shoulder dislocated, had a black eye, and we would be hand-on-ankle-dragged then thrown into the garage with the house door slammed shut as a punishment. Our mother manipulated everyone including us \[Ryu and his sister\] to believe we were normal as a small, happy family. We thought it was normal, as family matters are typically kept private, and we were naive children who did not know how bad it was.


Most of my peers seem to remember childhood through school events, family outings, and special interest groups as most memorable when asked in a public setting. Unfortunately, these memories are what dominated my life choices and thoughts during my childhood (~8 years old to ~17 years old, 2008-2017). I learned computer science because it would give me useful skills to financially escape my mother’s coercive control, and it happened to be something I was naturally interested in too.


When people ask me "So... how was your childhood, Ryu?” in a public setting, or when I am being interviewed, or when someone wants to get to know me, I panic and lie. I had people accuse me of making up my childhood (I was!) after my lies contradicted themselves. I refuse to put any more effort into censoring my whole childhood and reason for “getting started in computer science”. I have no hard feelings against the question itself; I just need to write this where curious people can see.
